## Interpreting indoor positioning as neural machine translation (NMT) problem

This repository is meant as final project after having attended CS224N (Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing).
Instead of targeting a dedicated NLP problem, the goal of this project is to apply the learned ideas to a different domain â€“ indoor positioning.
For educational purposes, the models are implemented in Tensorflow by subclassing tf.keras.Model as well as in PyTorch by subclassing torch.nn.Module.
Please open the README.ipynb for further details.
